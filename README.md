- Submit your solutions for AI feedback
- Clear exercises to try new challenges

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The app automatically detects your LM Studio setup. To customize settings, edit `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# LM Studio Configuration
llm_endpoint: "http://localhost:1234"

# Generation Settings
generation_settings:
  max_tokens: 2000
  temperature: 0.5
  timeout: 60
```

## ÔøΩÔ∏è Troubleshooting

### LM Studio Issues
- **Connection Failed**: Ensure LM Studio is running with a model loaded
- **Slow Responses**: Try a smaller/quantized model
- **No Models**: Make sure you've downloaded and loaded a chat model (not embedding model)

### App Issues  
- **Import Errors**: Activate virtual environment and install requirements
- **Port Conflicts**: LM Studio uses port 1234, Streamlit uses 8501
